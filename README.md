Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and example scripts for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset. EDA is a crucial step in data science that involves understanding the underlying patterns, anomalies, and insights in data through statistical summaries and visualizations. The goal is to help in data cleaning, feature selection, and ultimately prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.

Features
Data Cleaning: Methods to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.
Statistical Summaries: Descriptive statistics for each variable (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.).
Visualizations: Graphical insights through histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, and pair plots to reveal relationships and trends in data.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables to aid in feature selection.
Data Transformation: Techniques such as normalization, scaling, and encoding for preparing the dataset for machine learning models.
Requirements
To use the scripts and notebooks, install the following packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rinsan-K/Exploratory_Data_Analysis-EDA-.git
Navigate to the repository:
cd Exploratory_Data_Analysis-EDA-
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the EDA script or open the Jupyter notebook to start exploring.
